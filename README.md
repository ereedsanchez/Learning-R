# Learning R @ Belmont

Hello, I am Edwin Reed-Sanchez and I love to program, hack and tinker with technology. I also enjoy teaching students the basic programming principals that are universal with all programming languages.  

For this class we will be learning R, which is a widely programming language used for statistical and scientific analysis.
